## How It Works:
  ### Users start the quiz via /kvizstart.
  ### Random questions are displayed; answers are validated against the correct one.
  ### Users earn points for correct answers; upon achieving a high score, they can save it.
  ### The leaderboard is updated and shown at /score.
  ### This application combines Flask's simplicity with the interactive elements of a quiz game, making it a great example of a small-scale web application.
